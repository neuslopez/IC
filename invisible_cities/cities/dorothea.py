From ancient Greek, Δωροθέα: gift of God.

This city processes each combination of S1 and S2 signals previously
selected as pmaps by irene within an event to produce reconstructed
pointlike energy depositions. They consist of three dimensional
coordinates with some associated global S1 and S2 properties. The city
contains a peak/event filter, which can be configured to find events
with a certain number of S1/S2 signals that satisfy certain properties.
The tasks performed are:
    - Classify peaks according to the filter.
    - Filter out events that do not satisfy the selector conditions.
    - Compute S1 properties
    - Compute S2 properties (for each possible S1)
The properties of the S1 signals are:
    - Width  (time over threshold)
    - Energy (PMT- and time-summed amplitude over threshold)
    - Height (maximum amplitude)
    - Time   (waveform time at maximum amplitude)
The properties of the S2 signals are those of the S1 signal plus:
    - Charge (SiPM- and time-summed amplitude over threshold)
    - Nsipm  (number of SiPMs with signal over threshold)
    - X      (reconstructed x position using the barycenter algorithm)
    - Y      (reconstructed y position using the barycenter algorithm)
    - DT     (drift time, computed as S2 time - S1 time)
    - Z      (reconstructed z position using DT / drift_v)
    - Xrms   (standard dev. of the SiPM signal in the x coordinate)
    - Yrms   (standard dev. of the SiPM signal in the y coordinate)
    - Zrms   (standard dev. of the PMT  signal in the z coordinate)
    - R      (radial coordinate from X and Y)
    - Phi    (azimuthal coordinate from X and Y)
